## Preparing for development

1. Make sure you have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed. We use it to pull the RxSwiftExt dependency for development.
2. Check out this repository.
3. Do a `carthage update --platform ios --no-use-binaries`
4. Open `RxSwiftExt.xcworkspace` and start hacking!

## About contributions

There are multiple ways you can contribute to this project.

The easiest way to contribute is to report possible bugs, request features, [discuss ideas](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxSwiftExt/issues) and share excitement about this project. We use [issues](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxSwiftExt/issues) to discuss new operators for inclusion in the project.

You can also make pull requests. Other than bug fixes, please make sure you discuss your contribution in Issues first.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting new code, please make sure that it is backed by tests. When submitting code for a new operator, please make sure that:

- Your code documents what the operator does (see other operators for examples)
- You provide tests for your new operator
- You provide a demo playground page, and add a reference to this page in the playground index
